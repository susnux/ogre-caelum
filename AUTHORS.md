If you are a first time commiter please add yourself to this list for legal reasons.

You can get a list of recent authors from the VCS, e.g. via `git shortlog -sne`,
or conveniently looked up on the [GitHub web interface](https://github.com/RigsOfRods/ogre-caelum/graphs/contributors).
This does not contain all contributors however since the source code moved from SVN to git repositories.

Details on individual authorship of files can be obtained via the VCS, e.g. via `git blame`,
or the [GitHub web interface](https://github.com/RigsOfRods/ogre-caelum/commits/master). Again, this does not display all authors.
